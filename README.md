# Slave Free Trade | IDHack 2018 @ Tufts University

This project was created by a team of 4: Sebastian Coates, John Tagliaferro, Mateo Guaman, and Logan Herodes.

This project was created for the NGO Slave Free Trade to be a DApp proof of concept for a blockchain solution for verification and prevention of slave labor. 

In addition to the DApp, we provide a machine learning approach for the analysis of this newly generated public ledger data - a classifier for legitimate/fraudland worksites.
